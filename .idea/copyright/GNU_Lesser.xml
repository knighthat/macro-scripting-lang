    <option name="notice" value="GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE&#10;&#10;        Version 3, 29 June 2007&#10;&#10;Copyright © 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;&#10;&#10;Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document,&#10;but changing it is not allowed.&#10;&#10;This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions&#10;of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.&#10;&#10;&#10;0. Additional Definitions.&#10;&#10;As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License,&#10;and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.&#10;&#10;“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application&#10;or a Combined Work as defined below.&#10;&#10;An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which&#10;is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is&#10;deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.&#10;&#10;A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library.&#10;The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.&#10;&#10;The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work,&#10;excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation,&#10;are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.&#10;&#10;The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code&#10;for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work&#10;from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.&#10;&#10;&#10;1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#10;&#10;You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.&#10;&#10;&#10;2. Conveying Modified Versions.&#10;&#10;If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function&#10;or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed&#10;when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:&#10;&#10;     a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that,&#10;        in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates,&#10;        and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or&#10;     b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.&#10;&#10;&#10;3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.&#10;&#10;The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library.&#10;You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters,&#10;data structure layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:&#10;&#10;     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it&#10;        and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.&#10;     b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.&#10;&#10;&#10;4. Combined Works.&#10;&#10;You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together,&#10;effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work&#10;and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:&#10;&#10;     a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it&#10;        and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.&#10;     b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.&#10;     c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution,&#10;        include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices,&#10;        as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.&#10;     d) Do one of the following:&#10;         0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,&#10;            and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for,&#10;            and under terms that permit,&#10;            the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version&#10;            to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.&#10;         1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.&#10;            A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system,&#10;            and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.&#10;     e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise be required to provide such information under section 6 of the GNU GPL,&#10;        and only to the extent that such information is necessary to install and execute a modified version of the Combined Work produced by recombining&#10;        or relinking the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0,&#10;        the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code. If you use option 4d1,&#10;        you must provide the Installation Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)&#10;&#10;&#10;5. Combined Libraries.&#10;&#10;You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities&#10;that are not Applications and are not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:&#10;&#10;     a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,&#10;        uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.&#10;     b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library,&#10;        and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.&#10;&#10;&#10;6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.&#10;&#10;The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time.&#10;Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.&#10;&#10;Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version&#10;of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions&#10;either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you received&#10;it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version&#10;of the GNU Lesser General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.&#10;&#10;If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply,&#10;that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.&#10;" />
